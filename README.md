Creating a Netflix clone using HTML, CSS, and PHP involves replicating the platform's user interface and basic functionalities. HTML provides the structural framework for building the layout, CSS styles the elements to match Netflix's visual appeal, and PHP can be used for simple interactions like user authentication or content management. While this approach offers a solid foundation for understanding web development concepts, it's important to note that building a fully functional streaming platform requires a more complex technological stack and infrastructure.
